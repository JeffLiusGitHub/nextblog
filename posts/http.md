HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. In this article, we'll cover the basics of HTTP, including its methods, headers, and status codes.

## HTTP Methods

HTTP methods, or verbs, are used to indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource. The most common HTTP methods are:

- GET: retrieve a resource
- POST: submit an entity to a specific resource
- PUT: update a resource
- DELETE: delete a resource
- PATCH: update a resource (only part of the resource)

## HTTP Headers

HTTP headers provide additional information about the request or response. Some common HTTP headers include:

- Content-Type: indicates the media type of the entity-body sent in the request or response
- User-Agent: identifies the client making the request
- Referer: indicates the URI of the resource from which the request was obtained

## HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are used to indicate the status of a request or response. Some common HTTP status codes include:

- 200 OK: the request was successful
- 404 Not Found: the requested resource could not be found
- 500 Internal Server Error: a server-side error occurred

By understanding HTTP methods, headers, and status codes, you'll be able to better understand the way data is communicated on the World Wide Web.
